h2. Rexster 0.x

!https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster/raw/master/doc/images/rexster-santas-little-helper.png!

h3. Version 0.8 (Santa's Little Helper -- February 28, 2012)

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.tinkerpop.rexster</groupId>
  <artifactId>rexster</artifactId>
  <version>0.8</version>
</dependency>
```

* Added @PUT@ to the Indices resource to place elements in an index.  This changes split this functionality away from @POST@.  @POST@ is now only for creating new indices.
* @DELETE@ of index elements now accepts parameters to be sent as an entity on the request.
* Fix PermGen issues with Gremlin processing.  This is bit of a stop gap fix in that it simply resets the engine after so many script executions.
* The Gremlin Extension now includes a @language@ parameter so that one can specify the flavor of Gremlin that is being used.
* Gremlin Extension takes a @params@ extension and applies the keys and values within it to the bindings of the Gremlin script engine.
* Dog House uses require.js for module loading.
* Simple graph visualization through "JIT":http://thejit.org.
* Dog House provides a filter option when browsing vertices and edges.  Filters are backed by indices such that the user can select an index then specify a key/value to filter the paged results by.
* Dropped support for support for @application/x-www-form-urlencoded@.
* Basic authentication configurable through @rexster.xml@ and extensible via extensions to @AbstractSecurityFilter@.
* Better handling of null values being passed to Gremlin Extension as bindings.
* Allow configuration of the Rexster server host in @rexster.xml@.
* Launching an extension from Dog House that fails now properly removes the "Loading" spinner and displays the error.
* Encode the URI for extensions launched in Dog House so that they are properly encoded for cut and paste use.
* Added a mock @TransactionalGraph@ implementation so that a @TinkerGraph@ can be tested in a transactional mode (configured through @rexster.xml@).
* Results from the Gremlin Extension that are @Iterator@ implementations are now paging properly.
* Added the @load@ parameter to the Gremlin Extension so that it is possible to execute server-side stored Gremlin scripts.
* Gremlin Extension can be configured so that it does not execute scripts sent on the @script@ parameter leaving it to only process server-side scripts with the @load@ parameter.
* Gremlin Extension can be configured to cache server-side scripts.
* Sample Kibble
** Secure Sample Kibble shows how to get a @Principal@ from the @SecurityContext@.

h3. Version 0.7 (Brian -- December 7, 2011)

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.tinkerpop</groupId>
  <artifactId>rexster</artifactId>
  <version>0.7</version>
</dependency>
```

* Improved performance for most types of requests.
* Added two custom Rexster mime types: @application/vnd.rexster-v1+json@ and @application/vnd.rexster-typed-v1+json@.
** The @rexster.showTypes@ general parameter does not exist anymore and is replaced by @application/vnd.rexster-typed-v1+json@.
** Rexster respects the data types of POSTed @application/json@ mime type for edges and vertices.
** Extensive refactoring of content negotiation and unit tests around these changes.
* Fixed problem with the Prefix resource where SailGraph in read-only mode generated 500 (Internal Server Error) responses.
* Added SPARQL Repository configuration.
* Fixed error that appeared on multiple successive calls to PUT on the Vertex and Edge Resources.
* The @extension@ key in JSON responses now includes more information:
** The full URI to the extension resource (not just the relative URL).
** Parameters for the query string.
** The name of the extension (not just the description).
* Dog House has Rexster Extension support
** List all configured extensions for graphs, vertices and edges.
** Launch extensions that can be accessed with a GET and that return JSON.
* Dog House is kinder to SailGraph implementations (generally cosmetic changes).
* Rexster Console only hosts Gremlin-flavored script engine implementations.  Currently, that means that @gremlin-groovy@ is the only exposed language.
* Upgrade all Kibbles to use GraphSON.
* Sample Kibble
** New Parameters Sample Kibble shows how to deal with injecting different data types into the request.

  <artifactId>sparql-kibble</artifactId>
  <version>0.6</version>
</dependency>
```

* Support for High Availability mode of Neo4j
* The @rexster-stop.sh@ command is now consistent with the @rexster-stop.sh@ in terms of parameter naming and shorthand.
* Retrieve adjacency vertices through REST API of the vertex resource.
* Filter by multiple edge labels in the REST API of the vertex resource.
* PUT on vertex and edge resources in the REST API replaces all graph element properties with the specified set.
* Combine rexster-start.sh and rexster-stop.sh into rexster.sh with new @-version@ and @-status@ commands.
* If the @-c@ argument is not passed at startup, Rexster first tries to read @rexster.xml@ from the root of the working directory.  If it cannot be found then it tries to read from a resource.
* Dog House and REST API both serve from port 8182
** Dog House is at @http://localhost:8182/doghouse@
** The REST URI scheme has changed slightly to include a @graphs@ segment, as in: @http://localhost:8182/graphs/tinkergraph@
* RexPro sessions that remain idle for a configurable amount of time are destroyed.
* Support OPTIONS HTTP method for all REST resources so that HTTP Access Control works properly when used (eg. jquery).
* New Batch Kibble makes it possible to execute commands in a batch/transactional fashion.
* Bring all Kibbles up to the latest version of REST API changes for the current version of Rexster.

h3. Version 0.5 (Dog Star -- August 1, 2011)

```xml
 <dependency>
  <groupId>com.tinkerpop</groupId>
  <artifactId>rexster</artifactId>
  <version>0.5</version>
</dependency>
```

* It is now possible to mix and match root level extensions with pathed extensions in the same extension class.
* Support the @Accept-Charset@ request header.
* The Dog House Gremlin Console now handles UTF-8.
* The HTTP method is now displayed in the hypermedia for extensions.
* Added the @parseToJson@ parameter to the @@ExtensionRequestParameter@ so that it is possible for extensions to control whether or not a specific parameter's value is parsed to JSON or not.
* The @<graph-file>@ parameter @rexster.xml@ is now used to locate a graph, not to initialize it.  Affects @TinkerGraph@ and @MemoryStoreSailGraph@ implementations.
* When requesting an index by name @http://localhost/graph/indices/edge@ the index is wrapped in a @results@ key in the return JSON.  This is more consistent with other return values.
* Indices returned from @http://localhost/graph/indices@ or when requested by name have their class value set to @edge@ or @vertex@ as opposed to the full canonical class name.
* Short-hand command line options.
* Extensions can be broken up across multiple classes within the same namespace and name.
* Used the Blueprints @JSONWriter@ to serialize to JSON which fixed a number of problems related to serialization of multi-layered hashes and lists.
* Nulls in iterators returned through Dog House are displayed as "null".
* Rexster Console for evaluating scripts remotely on a Rexster server.
