This section will demonstrate how to create an Extension for Rexster. Lets start by creating a @PingExtension@ and then modify it over the course of the documentation.  The code for the @PingExtension@ can be found in the Extension samples within "Rexster Kibbles":http://rexster-kibbles.tinkerpop.com.

h2. A Simple Ping Extension

```java
@ExtensionNaming(namespace = "ex", name = "ping")
@ExtensionDescriptor(description = "Ping me.")
public class PingExtension extends AbstractRexsterExtension {

    @ExtensionDefinition(extensionPoint = ExtensionPoint.GRAPH)
    public ExtensionResponse evaluatePing(@RexsterContext RexsterResourceContext context,
                                          @RexsterContext Graph graph) {
        Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<String, String>();
        map.put("ping", "pong");
        return ExtensionResponse.ok(map);
    }
}
```

The [[extension|Extension Naming]] is named using @@ExtensionNaming@ annotation where a namespace and name is provided. The extension must implement the @RexsterExtension@ interface (or simply extend from @AbstractRexsterExtension@ which implements it itself). A method is provided called @evaluatePing@. This method is attached to the @ExtensionPoint.GRAPH@. Thus, when 

```text
http://localhost:8182/graphs/mygraph/ex/ping@ 
```

is resolved, a JSON object is returned that has the key/value ping/pong.

```javascript
{
  "ping": "pong"
  "version": "*.*"
  "queryTime": 3.765
}
```

Of course, you can (and probably will) interact with the @graph@ and perform some calculation. In these simple examples, no graph manipulations are discussed.

h2. Automatic Parameter Parsing and Self-Documenting Extensions

```java
@ExtensionNaming(namespace = "ex", name = "ping")
@ExtensionDescriptor(description = "Ping me")
public class PingExtension extends AbstractRexsterExtension {

    @ExtensionDefinition(extensionPoint = ExtensionPoint.GRAPH)
    @ExtensionDescriptor(description = "A simple ping extension.")
    public ExtensionResponse evaluatePing(@RexsterContext RexsterResourceContext context,
                                          @RexsterContext Graph graph,
                                          @ExtensionRequestParameter(name="reply", description="a value to reply with") String reply) {
        Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<String, String>();
        map.put("ping", reply);
        return ExtensionResponse.ok(map);
    }
}
```

There are two new add-ons to the @PingExtension@. 

# @@ExtensionDescriptor@: An annotation to provide documentation to the user when the extension fails.
# @@ExtensionRequestParameter@: An annotation to parse the JSON request object and provide value as a parameter.

Note what is returned when @http://localhost:8182/graphs/mygraph/ex/ping@ is resolved:

```javascript
{
  "message": null
  "api": {
    "description": "A simple ping extension."
    "parameters": {
      "reply": "a value to reply with"
    }
  }
  "success": false
}
```

By annotating the method and its parameters, an API is created. Next, resolve @http://localhost:8182/graphs/mygraph/ex/ping?reply=ping-a-ling@ and what is returned is:

```javascript
{
  "ping": "ping-a-ling"
  "version": "*.*"
  "queryTime": 4.281
}
```

h2. Getting the Request Object and Returning a Result Object

In Rexster, JSON comes in and JSON goes out (see [[Mapping a URI to JSON]]). Its possible to get the values of the JSON request object using @@ExtensionRequestParameter@ annotations. You can also get the JSON object directly with:

```java
JSONObject requestObject = context.getRequestObject()
```

Next, building up the result in a @JSONObject@ is as easy as using Java @Map@. When the result object has been constructed, return it with a @ExtensionResponse@ method (e.g. @ok@, @error@). That is all there is to it.
