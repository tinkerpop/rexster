Deploying an extension is not difficult.  To demonstrate the process involved, we will use the [[Sample Kibbles|https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster-kibbles/tree/master/sample-kibbles]].  

After building Sample Kibbles with Maven (@mvn clean install@), copy the @sample-kibbles-*.jar@ file (where @*@ refers to the version of kibbles you are building) to the @REXSTER_HOME/ext@ directory.  

The next step is to [[configure|Rexster Configuration]] the extensions within @rexster.xml@. For purposes of this example, we will expose the sample extensions on the @tinkergraph@ sample graph.  The @namespace@ for the samples is @tp-sample@.  Therefore @rexster.xml@ should be modified in the following manner:

```xml
<graph>
  <graph-name>tinkergraph</graph-name>
  <graph-type>tinkergraph</graph-type>
  <graph-file>data/graph-example-1.xml</graph-file>
  <extensions>
    <allows>
      <allow>tp:gremlin</allow>
      <allow>tp-sample:*</allow>
    </allows>
  </extensions>
</graph>
```

The addition of @tp-sample:*@ means that all extensions within the @tp-sample@ namespace are exposed on the @tinkergraph@ sample graph.  

We now need to consider the configuration of individual extensions.  In this case, the @MapConfigurationExtension@ requires some basic configuration in @rexster.xml@ for it to work properly.  Modify the configuration so that the @<graph>@ element looks like this:

```xml
<graph>
  <graph-name>tinkergraph</graph-name>
  <graph-type>tinkergraph</graph-type>
  <graph-file>data/graph-example-1.xml</graph-file>
  <extensions>
    <allows>
      <allow>tp:gremlin</allow>
      <allow>tp-sample:*</allow>
    </allows>
    <extension>
      <namespace>tp-sample</namespace>
      <name>map-config</name>
      <configuration>
        <some-key>some-value</some-key>
        <other-key>other-value</other-key>
      </configuration>
    </extension>
  </extensions>
</graph>
```

At this point, Rexster is ready to start serving the Sample Kibbles.  [[Start Rexster|Getting Started]] and access @http://localhost:8182/graphs/tinkergraph@ being sure to set the @Accept@ header with the @application/vnd.rexster-v1+json@ [[Rexster Mime Type|Rexster Mime Types]]:

```javascript
{
  "version":"*.*",
  "name":"tinkergraph",
  "graph":"tinkergraph[vertices:6 edges:6]",
  "read_only":false,
  "type":"com.tinkerpop.blueprints.pgm.impls.tg.TinkerGraph",
  "query_time":2.57055,
  "up_time":"0[d]:00[h]:01[m]:30[s]",
  "extensions":[
    {"title":"evaluate an ad-hoc Gremlin script for a graph.","href":"tp\/gremlin"},
    {"title":"returns the results of the toString() method on the graph.","href":"tp-sample\/simple-root"},
    {"title":"returns the results of the toString() method on the graph.","href":"tp-sample\/simple-path\/some-work"},
    {"title":"returns the results of the toString() method on the edge.","href":"tp-sample\/simple-path\/other-work"},
    {"title":"a simple ping extension.","href":"tp-sample\/ping"},
    {"title":"returns the configuration as JSON.","href":"tp-sample\/map-config"}
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the list of extensions configured and available are listed.  Note that only those extensions that are available for the @GRAPH@ [[extension point|Extension Points]] are displayed here.  As some extensions only work from the @VERTEX@ or @EDGE@ extension points they will not be visible here -- however they are displayed on their respective endpoints such as @http://localhost:8182/graphs/tinkergraph/vertices/1@.

h1. Service Loader

Rexster uses @ServiceLoader@ to expose available extensions.  When developing an extension to Rexster, it is necessary to include a @com.tinkerpop.rexster.extension.RexsterExtension@ file in @META-INF/services@ of the packaged extension to include the extensions to be exposed.  In the case of the Sample Kibbles, "the file":https://github.com/tinkerpop/rexster-kibbles/blob/8002e7d53c3596b211a6c386f5b80ad83f70f895/sample-kibbles/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/com.tinkerpop.rexster.extension.RexsterExtension lists each of the extensions to be made available through Rexster:

```text
com.tinkerpop.rexster.kibbles.sample.MapConfigurationExtension
com.tinkerpop.rexster.kibbles.sample.PingExtension
com.tinkerpop.rexster.kibbles.sample.PingAddOnExtension
com.tinkerpop.rexster.kibbles.sample.ProducesXmlExtension
com.tinkerpop.rexster.kibbles.sample.SimplePathExtension
com.tinkerpop.rexster.kibbles.sample.SimpleRootExtension
```
