Up to this point, it has been assumed that a parametrized URI is the input to a traversal. While this is true, the URI is actually converted into a JSON object and that serves as the primary object by which the traversal code can retrieve its parameters from. The mapping between a URI and JSON is described using an example (as taken from the Parameters Sample Kibble).

```text
http://localhost:8182/graphs/tp-sample/parameters?a=1&b.a=marko&b.b=true&b.c.a=peter&c=[marko,povel]
```

```javascript
{
  "a" : 1,
  "b" : {
    "a" : "marko",
    "b" : true,
    "c" : {
      "a" : "peter"
    }
  }
  "c" : ["marko","povel"]
}
```

There are two JSON documents used during a Rexster query:

# @requestObject@ (input) is generated from the query parameter component of the URI request. 
# @responseObject@ (output) is provided by extension the results of the evaluation.

Rexster provides support for parsing and constructing the @requestObject@ and @responseObject@, respectively.
